The Torresian crow (Corvus orru), also called the Australian crow, is a passerine bird in the crow family. The species has a black plumage, beak and mouth with white irises. The base of the feathers on the head and neck are white. The Torresian crow is slightly larger with a more robust bill than the morphologically similar little crow. A dog is an animal, but a dog is not a bird.
